# Job Portal & Recruitment Management System

A full-stack job portal built with **Django REST Framework** (backend API) and
**React** (frontend SPA), covering three role-based modules: **Student**,
**Recruiter**, and **Admin**.

---

## ✅ Features

- JWT-based Student & Recruiter registration/login
- Recruiter-owned Company profiles (with admin approval workflow)
- Job posting, editing, closing/reopening
- Job search with filters (location, job type, keyword, skills)
- Apply for jobs with cover letter + PDF resume upload
- Track application status (Applied → Shortlisted → Interview → Selected/Rejected)
- Recruiter dashboard: manage jobs & review applicants, update statuses
- Admin dashboard: platform stats, approve companies, suspend/reinstate users
- REST APIs for everything, built with Django REST Framework

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Django, Django REST Framework, SimpleJWT, django-filter
- **Frontend:** React.js, React Router, Axios
- **Database:** MySQL (SQLite by default for zero-setup local dev — see below)
- **Auth:** JWT (access + refresh tokens)
- **Tools:** Git & GitHub, Postman (for API testing)

## 🚀 Backend Setup (Django)

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env            # defaults to SQLite, works out of the box

python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser   # create an admin login
python manage.py runserver
```

The API will be running at **http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/**.
Django admin is at **http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/**.

> The superuser you create with `createsuperuser` is a Django superuser —
> to also make it show up correctly in the Admin dashboard's role checks,
> set its `role` field to `ADMIN` from `/admin/` (Users → your user → Role Info).

### Switching to MySQL

The tech stack calls for MySQL. By default the project uses SQLite so it
runs instantly with zero setup. To switch to MySQL:

```bash
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE job_portal_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4;"
```

Edit `backend/.env`:
```
USE_MYSQL=True
MYSQL_DATABASE=job_portal_db
MYSQL_USER=root
MYSQL_PASSWORD=yourpassword
MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_PORT=3306
```

Then re-run migrations:
```bash
pip install mysqlclient   # already in requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
```

---

## 💻 Frontend Setup (React)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The app runs at **http://localhost:3000** and talks to the API at the URL
configured in `frontend/.env` (`REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`, defaults to
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`).

---

## 🧪 Trying it out

1. Start the backend (`python manage.py runserver`) and frontend (`npm start`).
2. Go to `http://localhost:3000/register` and create a **Recruiter** account.
3. As the recruiter, go to **Company** and create your company profile.
4. Log in as an **Admin** (your Django superuser, with `role=ADMIN`) at
   `/admin/companies` and approve the company.
5. Back as the recruiter, post a job from **My Jobs → Post a job**.
6. Register a **Student** account, browse `/jobs`, and apply.
7. As the recruiter, open the job's **Applicants** view and move the
   application through the pipeline (Shortlisted → Interview → Selected).
8. The student sees the live status update on **My Applications**.

## 📝 Notes

- Resumes are limited to PDF uploads (`application/pdf`, `.pdf`).
- New companies are unapproved by default; their jobs stay hidden from
  students until an admin approves them from `/admin/companies`.
- Applying twice to the same job is blocked at the database and API level.
